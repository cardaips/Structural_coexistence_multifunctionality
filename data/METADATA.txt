This file contains information on the data available for the publication of "Stably coexisting communities deliver higher ecosystem multifunctionality.", it lists all abbreviations of data file names and gives information on the different units in which the data was measured.

(1) experimental design
These files contain several types of information on the experimental design of the study:

The file "plot_info.txt" is composed of several variables:
-> plot: describes the plot number
-> sp1-sp3: describes the abbreviation of each species present in the plot. For a list of species abbreviations, see the Table S1 in the publication.

The file "structural_coexistence_experimental_design.txt" is composed of predictions of coexistence mechanisms for each plot:
-> plot: describes the plot number
-> nitrogen: presence or absence of resource addition within each of the 48 plots (nitrogen addition was not analysed in the publication and is only indicative of the experimental design)
-> omega: structural niche differences obtained with the code "structural_coexistence_control_nitrogen.qmd" adapted from the publication Saavedra et al. 2017, Ecological Monographs
-> theta: structural fitness differences
-> feasibility: binary, whether or not the triplet is predicted to be stably coexisting
-> differential: estimation of indirect interactions
-> min.distance: minimum distance to exclusion, a measure of species coexistence strength, derived from the publication Allen-Perkins et al. 2023, Ecology Letters
All coexistence measures are comparable to ratios and do not have a unit.

The image "structural_coexistence_image.Rdata" is a summary of these two files, and is saved for more convenient loading by the code of the main analysis. 

(2) species alphas and lambdas folder ("biommatrix" and "biomintrinsic" files)

(a) estimates of species interaction
Files which names are a variation of: "biommatrix_month_year_treatment.txt" contain information on the estimates of species interactions obtained with our phytometer experiment (see Daniel et al. 2024, Ecology Letters, for more information on the method). 
They  come in the form of 18 x 18 matrices with columns and rows names being the abbreviated version of each species present in our experiment (see Table S1 of the publication for the list of abbreviations).
Interactions coefficients can be negative (competition) or positive (facilitation), and they represent the coefficient of a negative binomial regression of the biomass of the focal phytometer with the cover of a specific neighbour species. As they are equivalent to a ratio, they don't have a unit.

(b) estimates of species intrinsic growth rates
Files which names are a variation of: "biomintrinsic_month_year_treatment.txt" contain information on the estimates of species intrinsic growth rates obtained with our phytometer experiment. They are exclusively positive as they represent the biomass production of a phytometer growing alone. 

(c) standard deviation of species interaction
Files which names are a variation of: "SE_biommatrix_month_year_treatment.txt" contain information on the standard deviation corresponding to each respective interaction coefficient obtained with our phytometer experiment. 
They come in the form of 18 x 18 matrices with columns and rows names being the abbreviated version of each species present in our experiment (see Table S1 of the publication for the list of abbreviations).
They are strictly positive and represent the uncertainty of each corresponding estimation of the pairwise interaction between two species, as such, they don't have a unit.

(3) ecosystem functions
